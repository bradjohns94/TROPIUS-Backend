Media Controller:
=================
    *   Ocassionally, if 2 requests are sent from the TROPIUS frontend, the media
        controller will display the song selector options several times

    *   Songs/albums/artists with duplicate names will override to the first instance
        of the name in the JSON, changing the other spinners with it

    *   Songs/albums/artists with apostrophes in their names will fail to play, most
        likely due to text processing in the backend. Could lead to XSS issues.

Remove Host:
============
    *   Removing host does not update host spinners
